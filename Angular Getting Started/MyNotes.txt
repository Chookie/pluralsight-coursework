* Javascript module is encapsulation of methods and variables and functions
* The IIFE = Immediatley Invoked Function Expression - often pronounced "ify"
* Controllers are central to angular
* ng-include can bring in html from other files, reuse etc
* ng-show shows if truthy
* ng-filter : orderby etc
* $log = angular log service log, warn, info, error
* $location = location service to redirect
* $anchorscroll = scroll in to view
  $location.hash(id_of_div);
  $anchorscroll();  // scroll to the hash location we just set
* Customer service
  * use to share data between controllers.  3 views on screen would get same instance of controller.
  * Reusable logic
  module.factory("github",github);
Routing
  * use url for determining which view to show
  * All happens on the client in place
  ng-view - tells angular where to place template files on the layout file.
  Angular uses the client fragment part of the URL, the # sign.  Angular uses this by default. (Section 5.4 @ 09:26)
