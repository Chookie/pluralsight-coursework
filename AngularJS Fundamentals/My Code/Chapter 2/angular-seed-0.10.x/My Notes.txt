* Comments

Event directives

ng-DblClick
ng-Mousedown
ng-Mouseenter
ng-Mouseleave
ng-Mousemove
ng-Mouseover
ng-Mouseup
ng-Change

Other directives
ng-app
ng-Bind
ng-Bind-Template: Allows you to bind to multiple elements
ng-BindHtml
ng-BindHtmlUnsafe

Expressions
Javascript code snippets inside the bindings.  E.g. {{ 2 * 3 }}
Cant access maths, alerts etc but useful.

Filters
Modifying output
1 Formating
2 Sorting datasets
3 Filtering datasets
format is {{ expression | filter }}   so expressions is piped to filter
Built in filters
uppercase
lowercase
number  (format numbers)     E.g. {{ 3.14543 | number:2 }} => 3.14
currency (format currency)   E.g. {{ 34 | currency }} => $34.00 spricifies default locale but can change this.
date E.g. javascript date {{ 1356878588 | date:'mediumDate' }}
json - mostly used for debugging E.g. {{ {a:3, b:'c'} | json }}
orderby = prefix with a dash - to change order to descending, else is asc by default
limitTo = allow to only see first x items
filter = only show items matching the filter string. by default searches all data in the datasource.
    can use . in ng-model name to filter only 1 field. e.g. query.level

Custom Filters
See durations sample. {{ duration | durations }} sends numeric durations into filter which outputs text

Two way binding
Use ng-model ng-model="class.property" to bind form fields to model.  model binds to other elements or controller

Services
$scope is sample of service
Dont use $ in your serviec names as this is nomenclature for anguar services only. If you do it you may overwrite an engular one.
